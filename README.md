# NeuralNetworkNuggets
My personal repository dedicated to exploring and learning the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning. This repository serves as a collection of my projects, tutorials, and experiments. It's a space for me to document my progress, test new ideas, and deepen my understanding of these complex concepts.

## Notes
[1] MLP.py solves the MNIST classification problem using a multi layer perceptron network with sigmoid neurons and stochastic gradient descent.
